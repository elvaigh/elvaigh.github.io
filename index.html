						My thesis is part of the <a href="https://project.inria.fr/icoda/">iCODA</a> project. Taking data journalism as an emblematic usecase,
						the goal of <a href="https://project.inria.fr/icoda/">iCODA</a> is to develop the scientific and technological foundations for knowledgemediated
						user-in-the-loop collaborative data analytics on heterogeneous information sources.
						My PhD stands at the crossroad of content analysis, in particular natural language processing (NLP),
						and semantic knowledge bases, notably knowledge representation and reasoning and semantic web
						(SW). The overall goal consists in formalizing and experimenting approaches that permit constant
						back and forth between the two worlds. We will especially consider how knowledge bases can be
						used to improve content interpretation and linking, or to establish relations between statements in
						content and public data resources. Taking data journalism as an application scenario, we will seek to
						develop knowledge-aware content interpretation approaches to three main problems: (i)
						information extraction and entity linking; (ii) linking statements to external data sources, e.g., for
						fact checking; (iii) semantic interpretation of links, i.e., being able to explain why two pieces of
						content are related or how a statement relates to some particular data.

				     During my engineer's degree internship, I worked on the implementation and the test of a wireless sensor network for the company
						 <a href="http://www.develec.fr/en/">DEVELEC</a>. The project deals with the integration and the test of the 802.15.4 MAC/PHY layer in the running
						time operating system (RTOS) Leton. It included an implementation of the IPv6 protocol
						with 6lowPAN on contiki UIP stack. It alos included a server/client application, implemented using CoAP protocol.</div>
